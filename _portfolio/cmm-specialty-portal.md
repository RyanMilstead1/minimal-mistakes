## Overview
CoverMyMeds is leveraging the power of our provider, payer and pharmacy network to streamline the enrollment process, helping patients receive the specialty medication they need and continue their therapy, uninterrupted. The overall goal of the specialty portal is to implement a network connecting specialty pharmacies, providers and payers to more efficiently coordinate treatment with specialty therapies and considerably improve ongoing care management.

## Technologies

The backend of the application runs on system of Ruby on Rails microservices and the frontend is built with a combination of Rails views and Vue.js. We use postgresql as out database, Graphql for streamlined querying of data and Sidekiq to handle our job quieries.

## My Contributions

I worked on many aspects of this project. Initially I worked on the customer facing aspect of the portal that displayed specialty pharmacy case information to users. We utlized Vue.js for this portion to streamline the compontent layout of the portal and to help with the large amount of data that we were presenting. I also worked on administrative pieces of this project such as customer email factories for specific waypoints in customers perscription process as well as customer service tools used to log communication with customers.
