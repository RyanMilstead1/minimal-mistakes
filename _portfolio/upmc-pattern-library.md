## Overview
The MyHealth Online Pattern Library was developed to act as a container for the components and templates that are used in MyHealth Online and serve as a platform for designers and business owners to see how the new elements will function before altering the existing MyHealth Online application.

## Technologies

The frontend of the application is using the latest version of Angular and the backend services are built with .NET

## My Contributions

I collaborate on the design and implementation of the components and templates used in the pattern library. We have developed two distinct design patterns, one on the atomic level, which lays out individual components like inputs, checkboxes, tables, etc, and also on the molecular level, which lays out collections of individual components that make up parts of pages in the consumer portal.
