This application is built entirely on Ruby on Rails and utilizes Stripe for credit card payments and subscriptions. It also utilizes bootstrap for design, devise for authentication, and omniauth for social media login integration.

## My Contributions

I work mainly on the frontend of this project, helping the team to implement new design features and fix any existing bugs in the application. I also worked on the Stripe integration on this project.
